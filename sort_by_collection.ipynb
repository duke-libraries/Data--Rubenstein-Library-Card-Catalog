Copenhagen, Denmark     Karl Joachim Andersen ( 1847-1909), Danish flautist, was the most distinguished member of a family of eminent flute players. He was a member of the royal orchestra in Copenhagen  (1869-1877).

He made important contributions to the literature of the flute, including a set of forty-eight studies, \"Concertstlicke,\" with orchestral accompaniment.

Many of the musicians, if not all, were flautists, and some were professors of flute.
