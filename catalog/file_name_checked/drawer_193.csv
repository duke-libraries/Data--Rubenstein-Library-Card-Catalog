Occasionally she expressed a desire for Seaborn to be more communicative with her. Her letters also reveal that it was a financial struggle  to keep him in college. Her son Joe had also attended API, but when he is first mentioned in the correspondence he is already holding a job. Mrs. Johnson's letters cease in the middle of 1930, so she may have died about that time."
